The Corn Maze
Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first header about maxes fron agticultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearding about the mazes in Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own roght ourside of Council Bluffs.
Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope that your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year’s Coen Maze as we did building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at this year’s Corn Maze and AutumnFest.
Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled with twist and turns that’s good fun for adults and kids alike! See how adventours you are as you wind through the maze while talking an interactive quiz. Answer the questions correctly and recive addition cules to solve the maze. For familes eith young children, our maze is filled with jokes, riddles and quests. Try to be the first in your group to punch out your quest card by visting the secrect spots. this maze is the perfect sixe and hright for little ones. Resting places and educational displays are scattered thoughout.
