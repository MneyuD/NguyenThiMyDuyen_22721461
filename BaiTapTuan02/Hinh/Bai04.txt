Preserving Your Memories

Serapbook albums have existed sinee the
beginning o£ photography. However, the sad
faet is that photographs and most printed
material are not permanent: they will fade and
xyellow with age. Serapbookers of today are
-aware øf these problema, and the industry is
providing remedies to minimize deterioratdon.
TFor the best results, avoid using materials with
bình acid content which can cause photos and
p2per to đeteriorate. Another thỉng to avoid is
lignin, ä material that is the bonding element in
wood fibers, Over time, paper with lignin will become yellow and brittle, so you should
only use lignin-fee produets.
