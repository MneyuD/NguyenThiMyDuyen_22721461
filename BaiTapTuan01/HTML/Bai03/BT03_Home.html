            <span style="color: brown;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on
            your wonderful performances. <br> <br> I've started putting up a <a href="/HTML/Bai03/BT03_Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo
            CD, please contact me.

            <br> <br> Once again: <span style="color: brown;">BRAVO!!!</span> -- Mrs. Juroszek
