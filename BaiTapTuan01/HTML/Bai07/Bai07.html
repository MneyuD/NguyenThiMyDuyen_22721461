            <i> vertical</i> design provides all of the safety and control associated with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points can be set to
            prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural range of motion.
        </p>
        <p class="pa">
            You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy to insert and remove,
            allowing you to continue your workout without delay. The LSM400 works with all standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics">Olympic</a> weight plates
        </p>
